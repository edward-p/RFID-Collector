RFID-Collector

### Introduction

This is an Android Studio Project that enables you to use your Android device's NFC to emulate the ID of a Mifare Access Card.

ROOT NEEDED! NXP RESOLUTION ONLY! (so the configure file must be `/system/etc/libnfc-nxp.conf`)


__I'll appreciate it, if you add support to other devices.__
